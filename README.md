This is the first repository I have created.  It contains a.tflite file for a wake word and the corresponding .json, manifest file.
I have not been able to get this working on my Seeed Studio Respeaker Lite, so I do not recommend this as a working solution.
If anyone wishes to experiment with it, please feel free to do so.
